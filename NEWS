Changes from version 0.1 to 0.2:
-------------------------------

- The 'round' argument to compare() (and compareEqual()
  and compareFile()) may now be a function (of one argument).

- Better defaults are provided so that, if no specific method
  is provided for comparing objects of a certain class, a
  default comparison is performed.  For example, "lm"
  objects are compared as if they are just lists.
